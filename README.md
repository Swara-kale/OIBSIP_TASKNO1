**Iris Flower Classification**  

This project trains a machine learning model to classify Iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica, based on their sepal and petal measurements.  

**Dataset**  
The Iris dataset, used for this project, includes measurements for 150 flowers (50 samples per species) with features:  
- Sepal length & width  
- Petal length & width  

The dataset is available as `iris.csv` in the repository.  

**Dependencies**  
The project uses the following Python libraries:  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Seaborn  
- Matplotlib  

**Model Training**  
The training process is documented in the `Task1.ipynb` file. Three models are used:  
1. Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
2. Logistic Regression  
3. Decision Tree Classifier  

Each model is trained and evaluated for accuracy using the Iris dataset.
